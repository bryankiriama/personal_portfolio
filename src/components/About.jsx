          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I started my journey with a BSc in Engineering Physics
          (Applied Electronics and Microprocessors) at the University
          of Nairobi, which built a strong foundation in problem-solving
          and systems thinking.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I currently focus on software engineering, with strong
          proficiency in JavaScript and Python, and hands-on experience
          building applications using React.js, Node.js, and backend
          technologies such as Flask, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I enjoy building scalable systems with clean architecture
          and intuitive user interfaces, using modern tools like
          Tailwind and Bootstrap to deliver high-impact applications.
